description: After having his portrait painted, the incredibly handsome young Dorian
  Gray is captivated by his own beauty. Tempted by his world-weary and decadent friend
  Lord Henry Wotton, he wishes to stay young forever and pledges his very soul to
  keep his good looks. As Dorian's slide into moral decay progresses, his portrait
  is marred because of his many sins, becoming old and disfigured, while he himself
  remains young and perfect. The Picture of Dorian Gray, the only novel by Oscar Wilde,
  was first published in 1890 and warns against the dangers of decadence and corruption.
